I2CDriver is a tool for controlling any I2C device from your PC's USB port,
and can also monitor and capture I2C traffic.
It connects as a standard USB serial device, so there are no drivers to install.
On the main site
[i2cdriver.com](https://i2cdriver.com),
there are drivers for

* Windows/Mac/Linux GUI
* Windows/Mac/Linux command-line
* Python 2 and 3
* Windows/Mac/Linux C/C++

For developers: How to make a release
-------------------------------------

To release Python:

    cd python3
    rm -rf dist/*
    python -m build
    twine check dist/*
    twine upload dist/*

To build the Windows installer, you first need to build the two executables
``i2ccl.exe`` and ``i2cgui.exe`` then use an NSIS script to create the installer.

On Linux cross-compile ``i2ccl``:
  
    cd c
    make -f win32/Makefile

On Windows first make sure that you can run the GUI on the command-line, e.g.

    python python\samples\i2cgui.py

(You may need to install i2cdriver, wxPython and pySerial).

Then build the GUI executable using ``pyinstaller``:

    cd python\samples
    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=../../images/i2cdriver.ico i2cgui.py

This builds the executable in ``python\samples\dist\i2cgui.exe``.

The Windows installer is built with NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System). Download and install it.

Copy the two executables ``i2ccl.exe`` and ``i2cgui.exe`` into ``nsis/``.

Then build the installer with NSIS:

    cd nsis
    "C:\Program Files\NSIS\makensis.exe" i2cdriver.nsi

The script ``go.bat`` in ``nsis`` has an example complete flow.
